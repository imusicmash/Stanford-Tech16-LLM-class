Global ticket sales are estimated to exceed $1 \\nbillion. The tour’ s economic multiplier effect is signiﬁcant. As evidence, the Federal \\nReserve Bank of Philadelphia speciﬁcally noted in a recent Beige Book commentary that \\n“May was the strongest month for hotel revenue in Philadelphia since the onset of the \\npandemic, in large part due to an inﬂux of guests for the Taylor Swift concerts in the \\ncity.”  \\nThe Eras tour will conclude in late November 2024, roughly corresponding to the \\n12-month horizon of the market forecast in this report. As homage to the global\\nicon, our 2024 US Equity Outlook is subtitled “All You Had To Do Was Stay” – invested.\\nT\\nhe title of the song from Taylor Swift ’s 1989 album reﬂects our baseline forecast that\\ndespite intermittent volatilit y, fund managers will ultimately be rewarded for staying\\nin\\nvested through the end of next yea r.\\nContinued economic and EPS growth will lift the S&P 500 index to 4700 (+5%) at \\nthe end of next yea r.

Note that equity valuations appear less stretched in absolute and relative terms after adjusting for record high market concentration. The equal-weight S&P 500 has de-rated to the 74\\nth percentile P/E multiple since 1976, but the aggregate S&P 500 P/E \\nstill trades in the 87th percentile. The valuation premium of the aggregate vs. \\nequal-weight S&P 500 equals 27%, well above the historical average but below the Tech Bubble peak of 111% in 1999. \\nOur baseline macro forecasts point to a roughly unchanged equal-weight S&P 500 \\nP/E of 14x at year-end 2024 and a P/E of 18x for the aggregate S&P 500 index. We  \\nexpect the Fed has ﬁnished its hiking cycle and Treasury yields have peaked. Howeve\\n r, \\nsolid economic growth means the Fed will remain on hold until 4Q 2024, compared with market pricing of cuts beginning in 2Q. In our baseline, we assume real 10-year UST yields will equal 2.3% at year-end 2024. Based on our top-down valuation model, this macro combination supports the current P/E multiple, but implies little scope for valuation expansion. We forecast the yield gap will rise slightly from 315 bp today to 325 bp at year-end 2024. We believe the fundamentals of the largest stocks will support the current valuation premium of the aggregate vs. equal-weight S&P 500 index through 2024. \\nWe expect positive returns to equities, but a 5% return risk-free in cash remains a \\ncompetitive alternative. In the current interest rate environment, the 3-month Treasury bill yields 5.5%, similar to the earnings yield on the S&P 500 index. Households, mutual funds, pension funds, and foreign investors collectively have a current allocation to stocks (48%) ranking in the 97\\nth percentile vs. history while bond (20%) and cash (14%) \\nallocations rank at the 43rd and 23rd percentiles, respectively. We forecast most of these \\nownership categories will be net sellers of stocks in 2024. During 2023, money market mutual funds have received about $1 .2 trillion of net inﬂows compared with $17 billion inﬂows for US stocks. We forecast that at $550 billion net corporate buybacks will represent the largest source of demand for shares. \\nWe expect the equity market will oscillate in its pricing of alternative scenarios \\naround our baseline forecast. If economic growth is resilient but the Fed cuts the funds rate sooner than our economists expect, the corresponding valuation expansion would push the S&P 500 to 5000 (+11%). Howeve\\n r, if inﬂation concerns reignite, \\nleading to higher interest rates and weaker growth, valuations would contract and the S&P 500 would fall to 4150 (-8%). In a mild recession, we expect the S&P 500 would drop by 18% to 3700 at year-end 2024. \\n15 November 2023   4Goldman Sachs', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

There has been a surge in enthusiasm regarding AI, with mentions of AI in earnings calls declining during the 3Q earnings season after an earlier surge in 2023. Google search volumes for AI rose sharply in early 2023 but have since stabilized in recent weeks. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is seen as a potential driver of corporate earnings upside, with certain companies benefiting from the demand for computing power to run AI large language models. However, the impact on profitability next year is expected to be limited for most companies, with only minimal margin expansion anticipated in 2024 due to various factors like input cost growth, rising interest expense, and higher effective tax rates.\n",

Additionally, the global economic slowdown, disruptions in supply chains, and financial market volatility due to the pandemic pose risks. Other factors to consider are the company's efforts to reduce operating expenses, adjust cash flows, and decrease capital expenditure spending, which may impact financial performance.
